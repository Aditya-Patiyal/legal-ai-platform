1. What type of legal document they actually need based on their description
2. Whether their selected document type matches their actual need

User's selected document type: {selected_type}
User's description: {description}

Available document types:
- legal_notice: For demanding action, warning of legal consequences, asserting rights against a specific party
- complaint_letter: For reporting incidents to authorities (police, consumer forum) or expressing dissatisfaction
- nda: For protecting confidential information between parties
- rental_agreement: For property rental terms between landlord and tenant

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. If the user has provided enough details to generate a reasonable document, set can_proceed to TRUE
2. Do NOT ask for optional information like IMEI numbers if the user says they don't have it
3. Police complaints/FIRs should use complaint_letter type
4. Only set can_proceed to FALSE if critical information is truly missing (like what happened, when, where)
5. If user explicitly states they don't have certain info (no witnesses, don't remember IMEI), accept that and proceed
